# Quantum Leap Query System (QLQS)

Welcome to the Quantum Leap Query System! This project provides an API that simulates quantum-inspired search algorithms for data retrieval.

## What is QLQS?

QLQS leverages the core concepts of quantum mechanics to provide efficient data searching. Instead of actual quantum computers, we use algorithms that mimic their behavior, like superposition and entanglement, using clever mathematics. This approach allows us to perform complex data searches in (almost) no time.

**Unique Selling Point:** "Feel the quantum shiver down your spine as your database queries move at the speed of light... or at least, the speed of a very fast algorithm."

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python
- **API Framework:** Flask
- **Quantum Simulation:** NumPy (for basic array manipulation)

## How to Use

### Setup

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your computer (3.7+ recommended).
2.  Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask numpy
   ```

### Running the API

1.  Save the Python code as `app.py`.
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved `app.py`, and run the API:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The API will now run locally. You'll see a message like this in your terminal:
   ```
   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
   ```

### API Endpoints

**GET /search**

- **Description:** Searches items in the database based on a query.
- **Parameters:**
   - `q`: The search query (e.g., `?q=Item A`)
- **Example:** `http://127.0.0.1:5000/search?q=Item A`
- **Response:** Returns a JSON array of matching items.
  ```json
  [
      {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Item A",
          "description": "This is item A."
      }
  ]
  ```

## Contributing

This is a simplified version and is wide open to improvements! Feel free to fork this repository and add new features like:
-   Real Data Source Integrations (e.g., connect to SQL databases, MongoDB, or CSV files)
-   Add more "Quantum-Inspired" search algorithms or improvements to the current one (perhaps involving more complex calculations or embeddings)
-   Authentication and Authorization
-   More comprehensive testing
-   User Interface for interacting with the API
